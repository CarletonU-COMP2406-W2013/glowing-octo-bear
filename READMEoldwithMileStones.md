COMP 2406 Project Proposal

Group: glowing-octo-bear
Project name: Order-Up

Proposal: The premise of Order-Up is to provide a free web-based restaurant order placing
application. Many restaurants have some sort of software based system, possibly even proprietary, of placing
orders between the waiters and the kitchen staff, we are proposing something similar. Order-Up will allow for
a restaurant to create a profile, customising menus/prices/and table numbers. There will be two views, a kitchen
view and a waiter view. Waiters will then log in under the restaurant profile and push orders over the web
between devices to a kitchen computer that will display a constantly refreshing feed of new orders coming in.

Proposed Milestones:

  1. Architecture diagram & external library/program use
  2. Framework demo (running application skeleton)
  3. Implement waiter login
  4. Fill Database with food menu data
  5. Creates orders from fake menu item
  6. Populate menu with real data
  7. Send custom orders to database
  8. Implement live polling kitchen view
  9. Final code and documentation (April 10th)
