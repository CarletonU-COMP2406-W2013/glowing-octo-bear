**Summary:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__\_\_**

"Order UP"ù is a free web-based restaurant order placing application running on the node.js engine. Generally speaking *Order Up* can be broken down into two main components; the *waiter view* and the *kitchen view*. The Waiter view provides a menu complete with several categories (drinks, food, dessert .. ect) along with a pre-populated database of menu items for each. There May be many waiters logged in at one time for a particular business, each with the ability to drag and drop items into an order for a table, then push that order to the *kitchen view*. The kitchen view frequently checks for updates to the order database then prints them out into a scrolling panel with the item name and a timestamp. The kitchen staff can then view these orders as they continue to be sent.
