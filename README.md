COMP 2406 Project Proposal

Group: "glowing-octo-bear" 
Project name: "Quick-Serve"

Proposal (1 paragraph): The premise of "Quick-Serve" is to provide a free web-based restaurant order placing
application. Many restaurants have some sort of software based system, possibly even proprietary, of placing
orders between the waiters and the kitchen staff, we a proposing something similar. Quick-Serve will allow for
a restaurant to create a profile, customising menus/prices/and table numbers. There will be two views, a kitchen
view and a waiter view. Waiters will then log in under the restaurant profile and push orders over the web
between devices to a kitchen computer that will display a constantly refreshing feed of new orders coming in.

Proposed Milestones:

  1.Architecture diagram & external library/program use
  2.Framework demo (running application skeleton)
  3.Implement waiter login
  4.Fill Database with food menu data
  5.Add ability for waiters to create orders and send them to the kitchen view
  6.Implement live polling kitchen view
  7.Working prototype/demo
  8.Draft documentation
  9.Final code and documentation (April 10th)
